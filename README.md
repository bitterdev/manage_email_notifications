# Manage Email Notifications

Manage Email Notifications is a Concrete CMS add-on that hooks directly into the core and enables users to manage their email preferences on an individual level. This is especially useful for websites that send out a high volume of automated emails, giving users full control over which notifications they want to receive and which theyâ€™d prefer to disable. The add-on installs an account page titled "Manage Email Notifications" where users can simply toggle the different types of messages on or off according to their needs. This helps improve user experience and reduce unwanted communication.
